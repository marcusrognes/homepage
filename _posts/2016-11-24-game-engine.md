I've just set on the adventure; that is creating one's very own game engine.

"Why?" i hear you asking; "there are already many excellent, well implemented, sound structured and good looking game engines out there, with a lot of people smarter than you behind, so why bother?"

The answer is quite simple;

> “TO UNDERSTAND IS TO DISCOVER, OR RECONSTRUCT BY REDISCOVERY” (PIAGET, 1972, P.20).

I set out to create, rediscover and yes, reinvent the game engine, not because i believe it needs reinventing, nor that i can or will bring something new to the table, but solely to learn.

I have a couple of goals with this project:

<ul class="list">
    <li>
        Firstly, and most importantly, it is to learn;<br/>
        how to be able to create more advanced and complex user experiences, for better user engagement and stronger user attention.
    </li>
    <li>
        Secondly, it`is to brush up on some math and physics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lastly, it`is to have fun! (and perhaps to make some games in the progress)
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>

The current progress update; is that i have created the base loop, rendering, camera and object system.

The next steps are creating the UI system, and perhaps getting started on some physics.
